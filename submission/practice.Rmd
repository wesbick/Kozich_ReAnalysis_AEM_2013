**Scaling up.** The advantage of the dual-index approach is that a large
    number of samples can be sequenced using a number of primers equal to only
    twice the square root of the number of samples. To fully evaluate this
    approach, we resequenced the V4 region of 360 samples that were previously
    described by sequencing the distal end of the V35 region on the 454 GS-FLX
    Titanium platform (18). In that study, we observed a clear separation
    between murine fecal samples obtained from 8 C57BL/6 mice at 0 to 9 (early)
    and 141 to 150 (late) days after weaning, and there was significantly less
    variation between the late samples than the early samples. In addition to
    the mouse fecal samples, we allocated 2 pairs of indices to resequence our
    mock community. We generated 4.3 million pairs of sequence reads from the
    16S rRNA gene with an average coverage of 9,913 pairs of reads per sample
    (95% of the samples had more than 2,454 pairs of sequences) using a new
    collection of 8-nt indices (see the supplemental material). Although
    individual samples were expected to have various amplification efficiencies,
    analysis of the number of reads per index did not suggest a systematic
    positive or negative amplification bias that could be attributed to the
    indices. The combined error rate for the two mock communities was 0.07%
    before preclustering and 0.01% after (n = 14,094 sequences). When we used
    UCHIME to remove chimeras and rarefied to 5,000 sequences, there was a
    average of 30.4 OTUs (i.e., 10.4 spurious OTUs). Similar to our previous
    results, ordination of the mouse fecal samples again showed the separation
    between the early and late periods and increased stabilization with age
    (Fig. 4) (Mantel test coefficient, 0.81; P < 0.001). These results clearly
    indicate that our approach can be scaled to multiplex large numbers of
    samples.
